## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently learning software engineering at App Academy.
- I'm a multifaceted person who pride themselves in exellence and hard work.
- I have a strong educational background, including participating in the international bacculariate program during high school, attending a prestigious acting school, a data science bootcamp and now learning software engineering.
- I know that software engineering is the path for me because it brings all of my wants together: logical problem solving, creating and building, being able to share that creation and have user interaction.
